This project is an extension of the H3.net (c) Ken March at https://github.com/pocketken

Files with significant changes by Thomas Buck:
 - /Algorithms/Polyfill.cs
 - /Extensions/H3GeometryExtensions.cs
 - /Model/Latlng.cs
 - /H3Index.cs <- not sure whether this qualifies as "significant?"
 - /Utils.cs <- ditto
 - Various other files have quick fixes for syntax not supported in net481

New files:
 - /HashCode.cs - see license header in file
 - /SqlClrWrapper.cs - a whole file developed by Thomas alone!
